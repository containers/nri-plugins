# Introduction

The NRI plugins is a collection of NRI (Node Resource Interface) based plugins
to manage various aspects of pod and container life cycle. For example the
[resource policy plugins](resource-policy/policy/index.md) can be used to
modify the container resource allocation depending on available system
resources.
