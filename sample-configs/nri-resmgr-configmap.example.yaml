#
# This example creates 3 ConfigMaps:
#  - nri-resmgr-config.default: the default configuration
#  - nri-resmgr-config.group.foo: the configuration for nodes in group foo
#  - nri-resmgr-config.node.cl0-slave1: the configuration for node cl0-slave1
#
# You can assign nodes to group foo using the command
#   kubectl label --overwrite node $NODE_NAME nri-resmgr.intel.com/group=foo
#
# You can remove nodes from group foo using the command
#   kubectl label node $NODE_NAME nri-resmgr.intel.com/group-
