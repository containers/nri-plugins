## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've identified a security issue in a NRI Plugin Collection project,
please DO NOT report the issue publicly via the Github issue tracker,
mailing list, or IRC. Instead, send an email with as many details as 
possible to [cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io?subject=Security%20Vunerablity%20Report) or [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io?subject=Security%20Vunerablity%20Report).

Please do **not** create a public issue.

## Security Announcements

The containerd-security-announce@lists.cncf.io email list is used for messages about
plugins security announcements as well as general announcements and discussions.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the core maintainers within 3 working days.

Any vulnerability information shared with core maintainers stays within the project
and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

As the security issue moves from triage, to an identified fix, to release planning, the core
maintainers will keep the reporter updated.
