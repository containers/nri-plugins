# Policies

Currently there are two resource policies:

The Topology Aware resource policy provides a nearly zero configuration
resource policy that allocates resources evenly in order to avoid the "noisy
neighbor" problem.

The Balloons resource policy allows user to allocate workloads to resources in
a more user controlled way.
